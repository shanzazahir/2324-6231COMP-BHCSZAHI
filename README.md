Garden Cold Frame Monitoring System
Overview
The Garden Cold Frame Monitoring System is an embedded system designed to monitor and control environmental conditions inside a cold frame, providing a protected environment for germinating seeds and growing plants. This system helps ensure optimal conditions for plant growth, even in outdoor environments where temperatures may fluctuate.
Features

Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity inside the cold frame.
Customizable settings for temperature and humidity thresholds.
Data logging capabilities for tracking environmental conditions over time.

Hardware Requirements

ESP32 or similar microcontroller board.
ILI9341 TFT display.
DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.
Light sensor.
RGB LEDs for indicating system status.
Keypad

Software/Firmware Requirements

Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for programming the microcontroller.
Libraries for interfacing with the temperature and humidity sensor module.

Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Upload the provided code to your microcontroller board using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Connect the hardware components according to the pin configurations specified in the code.
Place the temperature and humidity sensor inside the cold frame.

Usage

Power on the system and place it inside the cold frame.
The system will automatically start monitoring temperature and humidity.
Customize the temperature and humidity thresholds if you want to, in the editable mode, to suit your specific plant requirements.
